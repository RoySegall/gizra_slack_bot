![Setup](../../images/webhook-step-1.png)

And now go to the webhooks page:
![Setup](../../images/webhook-step-2.png)

Add a new Webhook:
![Setup](../../images/webhook-step-3.png)

You can set up in the next way:
![Setup](../../images/webhook-step-4.png)

GitHub will send a request to do a sanity check. Just to make sure the address
exists.
